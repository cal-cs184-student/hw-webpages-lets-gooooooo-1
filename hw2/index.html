		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
	
		<p>Castelijau's algorithm allows us to define a smooth Bezier curve given a set of control points by linearly interpolating through each pair of consecutive points of a level <b>(1 - t)p_i + (t)p_i+1</b>, starting with the initial set of control points, with a given t parameter to create the points of the next level. This evaluation of the points of the next level recursively happens, taking the evaluated next-level points of the previous set as the input until only one point is evaluated for the next level. This one point is a point that lies on the Bezier curve, and to get the rest of the points that lie on the curve, Castelijau's algorithm is called with different values of t, spanning 0 to 1. Our implementation follows this exact logic, with us iterating (from 0 to n-1) through the set of provided points, linearly interpolating the current point with the next point with the given t parameter, and storing the evaluated point in a new set. Our implementation is recursively called, with each evaluated set being passed back into the algorithm until the set consists of a singular point.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

		<p>The Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by being the tool used to evaluate every Bezier curve needed for the Bezier surface. Given a grid of points, n rows of n points, every row makes up its own Bezier curve through Castelijau's algorithm, parameterized by a shared u value. Castelijau's algorithm returns a point from the Bezier curve, so given n Bezier curves defined by the n rows and a shared u parameter, n points associated with that u parameter are found. From there, those n points are used to create a moving Bezier curve through Castelijau's algorithm once again with a v parameter. It's moving because the Bezier curve changes with the u parameter as the defining n points are found based on that u parameter. Now, with the help of Castelijau's algorithm, a point is determined by an u and v parameter, allowing us to simulate a surface. We implemented it as described. For each row, we recursively linearly interpolated each consecutive pair based on an u value until we achieved a singular point for that row. With a single point from each row, we further recursively linearly interpolated each consecutive pair based on a v value to achieve a singular point. That singular point is a point that falls on the Bezier surface given a u and v value.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		
		<p>Given the current vertex, we first ensured that it was possible to obtain the three vertices that made up a triangle by checking first if the twin lay on the boundary. If it did, we moved on to the next available face in the iteration by repeating the process but on the half-edge that was next after the twin that lay on the boundary, which ensures that the twin of that half-edge was a valid interior face. If it did not lay on the boundary, the face the twin lay on was valid, and we collected the positions of vertices. Using these positions, we generated adjacent vectors of the triangle sides, which we used to get the cross product that pointed outward. This was the normal vector, but to get an area-weighted norm vector, we multiplied it by half because the magnitude of a cross-product is equivalent to the parallelogram form from the adjacent vectors. We repeated that process of calculating the area-weighted norm vector for every valid neighboring face of the vector, accumulating it along the way. Afterward, we normalized the sum of the face norm vectors to get the final area-weighted vector normal.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

		<p>Before changing any of the pointers to implement the edge flip operation, we made a reference to every relevant object and used notation similar to that of the illustration. Between the input BC edge that needs to be flipped to AD, an ABC triangle and a CBD triangle exist. We noted down and made reference to all the vertices: A, B, C, and D; all the edges: AB, BC, CA, BD, and CD; all the faces: ABC and CBD; and all the half-edges: AB, CA, BC, CB, BD, and DC. We implemented the changes to objects in order of those that needed the least changes to those that needed the most in order to avoid confusion. We modified the faces to point to half-edges we know would not be modified in our scheme like AB and DC, as we sought to change the triangles from ABC to ABD and CBD to ADC. We then modified the edges to half-edges, which were noted similarly to them. We selected arbitrary half-edges that are not from the input edge to be pointed to by the vertices, and finally, we modified the half-edges to make the behavior half-edges BC and CB reflect that of new half-edges AD and DA where the next values ensured the formation of the ABD and ADC triangles.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="before_tp.png" width="1000px"/>

				  <img src="flip_tp.png" width="1000px"/>
				  <figcaption>Teapot: After Flips</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>When making these changes, the first thing that came to mind was ensuring that the next half-edges reflected the flipped edge. That was the first thing we did, but we made a mistake in that we forgot that there were many mesh objects of different types that needed to be modified as well. After noticing our error and seeing unwanted results, we recalled that half-edges pointed to faces and vertices as well, and those objects pointed to specific half-edges, too. That is when we decided to go for our top-down approach, modifying the objects that the half-edges pointed to before changing the half-edges themselves.</p>
