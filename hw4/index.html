		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we worked to simualte the behavior of cloth. First, we created a grid of masses of springs. Then, we used external accelerations and forces due to the springs to update positions of the masses.
		Next, we worked to make sure that our cloth did not collide with spheres or planes so that the cloth would not pass through either. Then, we dealt with self-collisions by attempting to make sure we maintained some distance
		between the masses and correcting positions if they got too close. Finally, we dealt with light reflections and textures to make sure the materials were being illuminated properly and the proper image was being shown on the cloth.

		<p>The spring constant ks affects the cloth's reaction to attempts at deformation by external forces. When the cloth drops with a low spring constant ks, it behaves with more flow in that it folds within itself more, and ripples appear and propagate more easily throughout the cloth. At rest, more of the cloth is dragged down by the force of gravity, with the final shape of the cloth being more deformed as the cloth appears more stretched down from the pinned points. When the cloth drops with a high spring constant ks, there is more stiffness in the way the cloth moves. It appears to roll into its final resting position with barely any ripples appearing and propagating within the cloth. The increased resistance to stretching leads to the springs barely deviating from the original rest length, causing the drop to flow down like a chain of fixed-length pendulums rather than springs. At rest, the cloth maintains more of its original shape with noticeably less drooping downwards.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		</div>

		<p>Density affects the mass at each point mass of the cloth. With less density, less mass is at each point mass, leading to a smaller magnitude of force applied on each point mass under the same external acceleration. This leads to a low extent of deviation from the rest length for each spring, making the internal forces caused by them have a smaller magnitude as well. This is why when the cloth is animated with a small density, the cloth appears rigid with minimal propagation of ripples as the internal forces that cause them are of a smaller magnitude. There is less drooping than usual when the cloth is at rest because the external force is smaller, leading to less deviation from the rest length for each spring. The inverse is true, too. When the density is great, the magnitude of the external forces and the internal forces are greater for the same reason. The cloth in motion would have noticeably more ripples and propagations due to the greater magnitude of internal forces, and the cloth droops more at rest due to the greater magnitude of external forces.</p>

		<p>Within our simulation, the damping factor affects the velocity at which each point masses of the cloth is estimated to be in at a moment in time. The estimated velocity's magnitude has an inversely proportional relationship with the damping factor. When the damping factor is decreased, the magnitude of the estimated velocity is increased, and this leads to the positions of each point mass being updated to a greater extent than usual. The effects of this emerge as more ripples that propagate, appear, and disappear at a faster rate on the cloth. It also makes the cloth take longer to return to rest as the rate at which the velocity of each point mass decreases is lower. At rest, the cloth looks the same as usual. When the damping factor is increased, the cloth appears to drift into its resting shape at a slow speed and with very minimal internal ripples and bends, which makes sense because the estimated velocity is with a far lower magnitude, so the updated positions are a result of the diminishing effects of the external and internal forces.</p>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p> To implement collision with spheres, we checked if the distance 
			of the position from the origin of the sphere was less than the radius
			if so, there was a collision with the sphere. If there was a collision,
			we calculate a tangent point by extending in the direction of the (position - origin) and 
			length equal to the radius - length of (position - origin). 
			Next, we compose a correction vector by subtracting the last position from this tangent point.
			Then, we added the correction vector multiplied by a scale down coefficient (1 -f) and add it to the last position to get the updated new position.
			To implement collision with planes, first we determined whether the new position had crossed the plane from the last position
			by taking seeing if the displacement vector of each position from the given point on the plane had the same sign for the dot product between each of them and the normal of the plane.
			If dot products of the displacement vectors with the normal of the plane had different signs, there was a collision.
			If there was a collision, we can use the equation given in lecture for a ray-plane intersection where we create a ray
			with the origin as last_position and d-vector as (position - last_position). From the equation, we obtain a time of collision.
			Once we have the time of collision, we can use r = o + (t*d) to calcualte the point of intersection with the plane.
			Then we calculate the correction vector as intersection point - last_position and add surface_offset * (normal or -normal, 
			if last_position is on same side of plane as normal, then just +normal, else -1 * normal).
			Lastly, multiply the correction vector by (1 - f) and add it to the last_position to get our updated new position.

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p> In the above images, we can see that: for higher values of ks, the cloth ends up more spread out (presumably due to 
			a higher force of repulsion between the different point masses when they get too close to each other).
		</p>

		Below is a screenshot of the cloth lying on the plane.

		</figure>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		
		<p> To implement self-collisions, we started by creating a hash function which would take in position vectors,
			truncate each component to be a multiple of the size of the box components and then return a number corresponding to the truncated position (which is
			unique to each box). Then, we created a spatial map where we took all the point masses and put them in a map with the hash output as the key so that
			point masses inside the same box would have the same key. We would create a vector for each key where we add these corresponding point masses whose position hashes to the key.
			Finally, we check only each point mass with other point masses in the same box to make sure that they are seperated by at least 2 * thickness and if not, to add a correction vector to
			seperate them. For each point mass, we average all the correction vectors that we get between it and other point masses in the same box and divide the result by simulation_steps then
			add that quotient to the position to update it.
		</p>

		<p> The following images show the cloth in the process of falling.
			As it falls, the cloth folds on itself and eventually it spreads out a bit.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		
		<p> Shaders are another model for lighting, different from our previous method of ray tracing where instead of 
			trying to trace the path of a ray, we use a model called the Blinn-Phong model to add lighting components (ambient, diffuse, and specular).
			Vertex shaders deals with a vertex's attributes like the vertex's normal.
			Fragment shaders are further down the graphics pipeline from vertex shaders.
			Fragment shaders use the attributes set by the vertex shaders to figure out the lighting and material effects for fragments (groups of pixels).
		</p>

		<p>
			In the Blinn-Phong shading model, we divide the lighting effects into 3 seperate components that we add together at the end:
			ambient, specular, and diffuse. Ambient lighting is the lighting caused by the scene itself 
			so it is a constant value that is the product of an ambient intensity 
			of the scene and a k_ambient constant that we set. Diffuse lighting depends only on the intensity of the light source and the
			angle of incidence of the light ray. Specular lighting depends on the intensity of the light source, and the angle between the normal and the bisector
			of the vector from the surface to the camera and the vector from the surface to the light source.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following pictures show components of our Blinn-Phong model by themselves, then together.

		<p> In the follow pictures, the sphere and plane are shown when using bump/displacement shaders.
			Under the deformation shader, the sphere for example becomes less smooth and pockets of mishapen surface are more noticeable up close than for bump mapping
			where the sphere is still much smoother.
			In bump shading, we change the normal in the vertex's object space from (0, 0, 1) by -dU on the x-coordinate, -dV on the y-coordinates. Then,
			we change from object space to world space to get world space coordinates of the new normal for the vertex and we update the vertex's normal to that new value.
			In displacement shading, we start with the same process as bump shading, but then we also change the vertex positions by adding normal * height(u, v) * height_scaling 
			constant to each of the position values.
